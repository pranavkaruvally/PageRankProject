      The obsession
Everybody has an obsession in life. No matter how much money or effort you throw at that obsession, you are always left wanting for more. It can be anything. My obsession with audio systems started when I was still a young boy. We visited one of my dad's friends who had an excellent audio setup at his home. I can't recall what brand speakers they were, but they were floor-standing stereos. At an age when I didn't even know the word orgasm existed, I'm pretty sure I had an audiogasm when I listened to A.R Rahman's Bombay movie soundtrack on his setup. Later on my dad would buy me a Chinese MP4 player for a school trip to Rajasthan (brand name was JXD if anyone wants to know). That trip probably marked the beginning of my obsession with music. From that point onwards, I have owned a lot of audio gear - probably almost all of the iPods that Apple released, a couple of Sennheiser earphones and headphones, a number of cheap but good Chi-Fi audio gear, and as of today a pair of Sennheiser HD599 headphones for home and a Sony WH-1000XM3 for jogging and the gym. Of course, it goes without saying the countless amps and DACs I have had to go with them (most of them Chi-Fi, I love cheap and good Chi-Fi products). I also have a lovely pair of active bookshelf speakers by Edifier at home - they make some seriously good budget systems. In 2009 my dad purchased a Tata Indica Xeta and installed aftermarket Pioneer head unit paired with 6x9 JBL coaxials. That was not the best audio setup I had known, but it was pretty good for what he paid. On every trip we had, I'd find myself constantly fiddling with the parametric equalizer and making sure each song I played was rendered perfectly to my ears. I begged him to go bonkers with the audio system - maybe install some subs in the trunk and go for components up front. But my sane minded father wouldn't budge. So I waited until I bought my own car some 15 years later, which is a 2022 model VW Polo TSI Highline Plus.
As with everything, my taste in music changed as I grew up. I used to like very forward and in-your-face soundstage as a teenager, but now I prefer a laid-back, smooth, expansive soundstage and a neutral frequency response with a natural timbre. As an audiophile, my mantra is to look for the most you can get at the cheapest you have to shell. I don't believe that expensive = better. In most cases, yes it is true. But there are always exceptions. And audio is an area where the law of diminishing returns is very pronounced
The itch
I was actually quite satisfied with the stock setup on the Polo, but there was always this feeling in my heart making me wonder how much better this setup could be. I held myself back due to fears of the warranty getting cancelled - until I couldn't anymore. So after just six months of ownership, I decided its time to spice up my car audio system. The itch for better audio was just becoming unbearable! My first purchase was a Sony XS-AW8 under-seat subwoofer. Now, I know what you are probably thinking - which audiophile in his right mind would go for Sony audio gear?! But hear me out. I liked the stock audio system as is, I just wanted a little more bass. I like my music very neutral. I dislike the ground-shattering, earthquake-inducing, bum-vibrating loud and boomy ostentatious bass from the trunk that is many teenage boys' wet dream about car audio (guilty as charged myself). I searched a lot for under-seat subwoofers within my budget of Rs. 17,000 but couldn't find many options. So, Sony it was. Ordered it from Amazon for ~Rs.15,000. The day it arrived, I took my car to a local installer and got it installed.
