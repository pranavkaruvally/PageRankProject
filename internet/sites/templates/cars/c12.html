    <h1 class="heading">Hyundai Tucson - First Drive</h1>
    <p class="content">
      Did you know that the number of SUVs sold in 2020 was close to 25000, amounting to 22% of the Indian automotive industry? In 2022 this number has come up to 49,000, nearly double the amount in 2020. Currently, the SUV market share is over 41%, and estimated growth is up to 65,000 units by 2025. Catering to the skyrocketing demand for SUVs and premium SUVs in the Indian automotive market, Hyundai has launched their flagship premium SUV in India, known as the Hyundai Tucson. This one is a global bestseller product for Hyundai, and we explore this premium SUV in Nandi Hills, Bangalore. Our drive was made exciting as we drove through windy scenic roads in both the trims offered by Hyundai.
Strong inside, sporty outside 
Hyundai claims a strong body structure with the hot-stamping application. The body is made of 26.4% mild steel, 17.7% high-strength steel, 15.6% hot stamping, 40.3% advanced high-strength steel and extended application of as high as 74% overall. This rigid, lightweight chassis is aided by HTRAC – All Wheel Drive System with Multi-Terrain modes. Modes include SNOW, MUD, and SAND. While this global bestseller is offered in multiple drivetrains globally, including a hybrid, India gets two options. The first one mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission is a 2.0l petrol engine that produces 156 ps and 192 Nm torque. And finally, a much more robust 8 Speed Automatic Transmission operated 2.0L Diesel engine produces 186 PS and an enthusiastic 415 Nm torque. India gets the LWB – long wheelbase version as standard.
Tantalising appearance
Hyundai Tucson has been in the international market for some time, but there is nothing in its price range in India that looks alike. The front smiling large grille with dark chrome design neatly integrates with nickel chrome metallic semi-deposition Inside the 5-point Parametric hidden LED and DRL lens. With the DRLs off, the entire unit looks like a single piece of design mimicking a significant smile. At 4,630mm, the new Tucson has grown significantly more than its predecessor. The wheelbase is more extensive at 2,755mm and is a considerable upgrade from its 2016 avatar. Camouflaging this large SUV is a series of design choices by the Hyundai design team and engineers to make Tucson look premium yet sporty. Complementing the design is the choice of multi-toned elements like a matte silver window sill that ends in an aerodynamic style at the rear. The design makes this large SUV feel more friendly and compact with visual illusions created by sharp lines. 
The most appealing section of this beauty is the connecting rear-LED with unique diamond-cut elements making this SUV prettier in real life. It extends on both sides of the car and makes this rear element a timeless piece of design which will age well. There’s a subtle Tucson batch with a hidden rear wiper under the spoiler. Matte grey skid plates and boxed-out wheel arches add character to the Tucson. Many design elements with creases, lines and cuts make this car feel true to a concept design. The sharp-cut design elements also translate into the large 235 section 18-inch dual-tone diamond-cut alloys, with a full-size spare alloy wheel in the trunk. The powered tailgate liberates 540L of cargo space with three levels of gate adjustments. It can be extended to 1860 litres with dedicated levers in the trunk to enable 60:40 split-folding second-row seats. The boot gets a guidance light and extra 12V sockets for added functionality.
A chiselled body technophile
Hyundai always offers its customers top features, and the flagship hits the ball right out of the park. Onboard computers in Tucson provide innovative features like Home to Car (H2C), where simple vocal commands to Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant can operate your car. Voice commands could include, “Alexa, turn on my car’s AC”, “Alexa, turn on my car’s AC, “Alexa, find my car”, “Alexa, check my car’s fuel level”, and “Alexa, lock my car doors.” Advanced connectivity also allows Smartwatch connectivity with TIZEN, iOS and Android. 
Bluelink app offers 60+ connected features, and the car infotainment setup can improve with time thanks to OTA – Over-The-Air updates for the system and map. Tucson also gets Hyundai’s most advanced Voice Control for Seat Ventilation, Sports (Cricket, Soccer), Sunroof, and climate control, while the Voice Assistant has 104 embedded voice commands. 
The large 10.25″ HD infotainment system is India-specific yet global ul supports -10 regional + 2 international languages, including English, Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Hindi, Punjabi, Malayalam, Telugu, Oriya, Gujarati and Korean. Apart from these, the 8-speaker premium Bose sound system can accompany your drive with six built-in ambient nature symphonies, including an open-air café, rainy day, snowy village, warm fireplace and calm sea waves. There’s Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but Hyundai has missed the mark by not making these wireless. With OTA updates, these wired features may go wireless in the future.
