    <p class="content">
      High-protein diets are all the rage, but one outdoes all the rest. It’s aptly named the carnivore diet, and it focuses on meat, just meat. If that sounds questionable from a health perspective, that’s because it is.
While some research backs up the benefits of more balanced high-protein diets, many experts are skeptical about the carnivore diet, in spite of endorsements from a small group of extreme athletes and celebrities including the podcaster Joe Rogan. In January 2022, Rogan announced on Instagram that in honor of World Carnivore Month, he would eat only meat and fruit (the latter is not officially part of the diet, but more on that below).
Judging by what science has determined about the nutrients necessary for human health, it's more likely that people who try a meat-only diet for an extended period will end up like the singer James Blunt, who revealed that he had developed scurvy after attempting a carnivore diet. But with people like Rogan still following it, you may want to learn exactly what it entails and the potential risks. This guide will tell you everything you need to know about this animal-based eating pattern.
What Is the Carnivore Diet Exactly, and How Does It Work?
Unlike other high-protein, low-carb diets, the carnivore diet allows zero carbs. It includes “only foods that either walked, swam, or flew,” says Kelly Schmidt, RD, a holistic dietitian in private practice in Columbus, Ohio. While it may be a trend, “eating only meat is not sexy,” she says. “It’s not colorful, and it’s not fun.” Most people who try the diet are motivated by a strong desire to lose weight or to address an autoimmune condition.
The carnivore diet is often a step people take after trying the paleo diet or the ketogenic diet, says Diana Rodgers, RD, of the Sustainable Dish, located in Concord, Massachusetts. Paleo (aka the “caveman” diet) focuses on fresh fruits, vegetables, grass-fed meats, and wild seafood, while eliminating added sugars, grains, dairy, and legumes.
The ketogenic diet — also called “keto” — is a very higLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aut vero harum
